.SH FOOTNOTES
This program does not attempt to perform full-fledged XML parsing.
It is merely compatible with \fIunber\fR\|(1)'s output.
In particular, XML style comments are not supported.
A hash "\fB#\fR" or two dashes "\fB--\fR" following a whitespace is treated as a beginning of a comment line, which is ignored completely.
Empty lines are ignored as well.
.P
The following example demostrates the use of comments:
.Vb
<C O="0" T="[1]" TL="2" V="2">
    <I O="2" T="[1]" TL="2" V="Indefinite">
    \fB--\fR </I O="4" T="[UNIVERSAL 0]" L="4">
    \fB#\fR Do not terminate:
    \fB#\fR the absence of end-of-content octets is intentional!
</C O="6" T="[1]" L="6">
.Ve
